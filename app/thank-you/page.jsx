/* ============================================================================
   PAGE 4 · THANK-YOU
   STRUCTURE SOURCE: thefoodfreedomco.com/thank-you (live).
   Styles + full anatomy rationale: app/sections/p03-thankyou.css.

   FFC's element order, matched exactly:
     header logo
     → "BOOKING CONFIRMED" pill
     → one serif headline, the coach's NAME set italic-accent
     → card · "What We Will Cover On The Call"  (ruled tick list)
     → card · "Before You Show Up"               (ruled tick list)
     → minimal footer

   FFC ships this DARK; per the client's decision + SESSION-HANDOFF §3B this
   matches the STRUCTURE and HIERARCHY on our light surface in the brand hue.
   No video, no appointment card, no policy block, no CTA — FFC's thank-you
   sells nothing and asks for nothing. The only KPI here is show-up.
   ========================================================================== */

/* FFC "What We Will Cover on the Call" — five points, adapted to the overlap
   (PCOS · thyroid · insulin resistance). Every line maps to one of FFC's, so
   nothing here is invented; the last keeps our contractual refund posture. */

  'What is actually happening underneath (whether it is PCOS, thyroid, insulin resistance, or all three at once) and why your body stopped responding to the things that used to work.',
  'Why the previous approaches did not last, and what that tells us about what your body actually needs right now.',
  'How your weight, your markers and your week are connected, and which one we start with.',
  'What it would realistically take to shift what you are experiencing, including the parts that take months rather than weeks.',
  'Whether Reset is the right fit for where you are right now. Shruti will tell you directly either way, with no pressure to enrol if it is not.',
];

/* FFC "Before You Show Up" — three rules, then the inbox/link note last. The
   note carries a VERIFY chip until QT.2 confirms what actually gets sent. */
