   STRUCTURE PROVENANCE — this file is shaped to the CONVERGENT hierarchy of the
   two live reference funnels (teamfitarjun.com + thefoodfreedomco.com), read
   page by page on 2026-07-23, not to a summary of them.

   `bold:` arrays mark the clauses that carry mixed-weight emphasis, because
   both references write these as ONE paragraph with a bolded clause rather
   than a bold lead + separate body.

   PROVENANCE RULE unchanged: every number, name and condition comes from the
   strategy document or the transformation stories. `gap:` marks a fact we are
   not allowed to invent; it renders as a visible chip mapped to a question in
   QUESTIONS-FOR-CLIENT.txt.
